# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

Each group member will be contributing equally to the R.venger project. The group will meet weekly upon the agreement and availability of all members. Each member is expected to attend the weekly meeting on time and with all responsible tasks completed which are discussed prior to the meeting. Discussions are expected to be efficient and respectful among all members. 

All group members are responsible for understanding and verifying all the functions, tests and documentations included in the R.venger package, as well as the legitimacy of the OMDb API usage and relative materials.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within the R.venger group, and also applies when other contributors are revising or editing the package.
